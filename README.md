# Dash-based Carrera Race Management System

After playing some rounds at home with our new Carrera slot racing track, this weekend I decided to tackle the project to build a Race Management System. The idea is having some display in the middle of the rack that shows relevant position to the drivers.

The architecture I went for is a server connected to the Carrera system via its [AppConnect](https://www.carrera-toys.com/en/product/20030369-carrera-appconnect) Bluetooth interface, and this server publishing a real-time dashboard over web. This way, any system like a tablet or a smartphone with a web browser can be used as display in the race. Here an example screenshot of my smartphone during a test race:

## Interfacing to Carrera track

Here I am standing on the shoulders of giants: using the fantastic Python library [carreralib](https://github.com/tkem/carreralib) by [Thomas Kemmer](https://github.com/tkem), developed using the great work by Stephan He√ü aka [slotbaer](https://www.slotbaer.de)).

## Serving a real-time dashboard over HTTP

For this part I went for [dash](https://dash.plotly.com/), a web server based on Flask that makes the building of real-time sites a piece of cake. I configured an interval of 60 seconds for the display (that tablet or smartphone next to the track showing the real-time data) to update its values, which seems to be easy to take for the Carrera track (1 request per minute). If using multiple displays, you might want to reduce the update interval, otherwise the Carrera track will not cope with simultaneous requests and you might get some error message.
